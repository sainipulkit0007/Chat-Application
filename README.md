# Chat-Application

The Java Chat application is a console application that is launched from the command line. The server and clients can run on different computers in the same network. There can be multiple clients connect to a server and they can chat to each other, just like in a chat room where everyone can see other users’ messages. There’s no private chat between two users. The user says ‘bye’ to quit the chat. The application consists of two parts: server and client. Each part can run independently on separate computers.
